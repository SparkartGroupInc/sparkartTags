# sparkartTags

jQuery plugin for creating a simple tag input.

SparkartTags converts a simple text input into a dynamic tag input. Tags can be typed in and completed with either the `enter` or `,` key. Tags created with this input are added to the parent `<input>` as a comma separated list.

## Usage

In order to use sparkartTags you'll need to include jQuery and the jquery.sparkartTags.js file ( the jquery.sparkartTags.css file is highly recommended, but still optional ).

**A basic tag input**

```html
<input id="tags" type="text" value="javascript,jquery" />
<script>
	$('#tags').sparkartTags();
</script>
```

Existing values for the input will be converted into tags automatically.

**A customized tag input**

```html
<input id="tags" type="text" value="javascript,jquery" />
<script>
	$('#tags').sparkartTags({
		value: 'ruby,rails',
		placeholder: 'Add a language'
	});
</script>
```

If `value` is manually specified, it will override the value of the input.

**A tag input with auto-suggest**

```html
<input id="tags" type="text" />
<script>
	var languages = ['javascript','ruby','python','php'];
	$('#tags').sparkartTags({
		suggest: {
			source: languages
		}
	});
</script>
```

You must include the [sparkartSuggest](https://github.com/SparkartGroupInc/sparkartSuggest) plugin to use `suggest`.

## Configuration

* **value** - *(string)* - A comma separated list of tags to include when the plugin first loads. Overrides the value of the input `sparkartTags` is called on.
* **placeholder** - *(string)* - The value of the placeholder for the tag input. Defaults to "add a tag".
* **suggest** - *(object)* - A configuration object for the [sparkartSuggest](https://github.com/SparkartGroupInc/sparkartSuggest) plugin. The plugin must be included in order for this to work.
